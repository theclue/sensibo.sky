## How you can contribute

There are several ways you can contribute to this project. If you want to know more about why and how to contribute to open source projects like this one, see this [Open Source Guide](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/).

### Share the love ‚ù§Ô∏è

Think our_package is useful? Let others discover it, by telling them in person, via Twitter or a blog post.

Using sensibo.sky for a paper you are writing? Consider citing it.

### Ask a question ‚ÅâÔ∏è

Using our_package and got stuck? Post your question as an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/theclue/sensibo.sky/issues/new). While I cannot guarantee user support, I'll try to do our best to address it, as questions often lead to better documentation or the discovery of bugs.

Want to ask a question in private? Contact the package maintainer on [https://gabrielebaldassarre.com][his website].

### Propose an idea üí°

Have an idea for a new our_package feature? Take a look in the repo to see if it isn't included or suggested yet. If not, suggest your idea as an issue or perform a __pull request__. While we can't promise to implement your idea, it helps to:

* Explain in detail how it would work.
* Keep the scope as narrow as possible.

See below if you want to contribute code for your idea as well.

### Report a bug üêõ

Using sensibo.sky and discovered a bug? That's annoying! Don't let others have the same experience and report it as an issue so we can fix it. A good bug report makes it easier for us to do so, so please include:

* Your operating system name and version (e.g. Mac OS 10.13.6).
* Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting (for ex. R versions, system libraries and so on.).
* Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.

### Improve the documentation üìñ

Noticed a typo on the website? Think a function could use a better example? Good documentation makes all the difference, so your help to improve it is very welcome!

#### Function documentation

Functions are described as comments near their code and translated to documentation using [`roxygen2`](https://klutometis.github.io/roxygen/). If you want to improve a function description:

1. Go to `R/` directory in the [code repository][repo].
2. Look for the file with the name of the function.
3. [Propose a file change](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-user-s-repository/) to update the function documentation in the roxygen comments (starting with `#'`).

### Contribute code üìù
