# Round 2 (Resubmission)

Martina Schmirl <martina.schmirl@jku.at>:

Thanks,

Please always write package names, software names and API names in 
single quotes in title and description.

Please only capitalize sentence beginnings and names in the description 
text. --> ".. air conditioning units see ..."

Please fix and resubmit.

Best,
Martina Schmirl

* **Added the single quotes in DESCRIPTION file (title and description)**
* **Fixed wrong uppercase in DESCRIPTION file (description)**

There was one NOTE:

This note should be intended a false positive, as _Sensibo_ is the proper name of the product.
